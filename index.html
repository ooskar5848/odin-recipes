    <p>During my time at university, I have gained a certain element
        of culinary mastery. Most students just eat Tesco Meal Deals,
        but I am cut from a different cloth. This short website is 
        a bank of recipes I'd consider myself to have mastered
        during my time at university. I apologise for the blankness 
        of this website. I haven't learned CSS yet, it's just HTML.
