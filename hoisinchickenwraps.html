        <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>The Hoisin Chicken Wrap is my personal favourite. The fantastic
            thing about this recipe is that it is so open to interpretation-
            once the basis of the wrap is formed, anything you like can go in 
            as well. It is a relatively new recipe, made popular by gourmet
            chicken shops. </p>

            <h4>Ingredients (feeds 4)</h4>

                <li>Mature Cheddar (200g)</li>
                <li>Oregano or similar herbs</li>
                <li>Grill seasoning (optional but recommended)</li>
                <li>Any other extras- rice, roasted peppers, chorizo, halloumi, and fluffy potatoes all work well</li>
            </ul>
              
            <h4>Steps</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Firstly, dice the raw chicken into medium 
                    sized fillets. If you are using boned chicken,
                    make sure to debone. Do not cross contaminate 
                    and make sure to keep washing your hands and objects 
                    touched by raw chicken. Leave the chicken to grill 
                    on gas mark 6 for 10 minutes, making sure to flip it over 
                    5 minutes through.</li>
                    <li>Whilst the chicken is cooking, prepare the wraps.
                        Peel strips of lettuce from the head and place three 
                        each into each wrap. Cut three long slices of Cheddar
                        for each wrap and place inside.</li>
                        <li>Season each side of the chicken whilst flipping
                            it, with a heavy sprinkling of oregano or whatever herbs
                            you have to hand, and grill seasoning.</li>
                            <li>Once the chicken is thoroughly cooked, pour 
                                the hoisin sauce into the frying pan and mix with 
                                the chicken. Make sure to just coat it thickly,
                                not to drown the chicken in hoisin so the wraps
                                don't get damp.</li>
                                <li>Any extras would be put in the wraps now. 
                                    I reccommend any of the optional ingredients 
                                    stated above, especially halloumi or peppers. Your 
                                wraps should now be complete.</li>
            </ol>
